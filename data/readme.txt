KuKa on sea ice in the North Cove
Date: 15/08/2023
Conditions: Gentle winds from Ne


sea ice was scanned by KuKa on North cove along a 35 m transect running parallel to the shore. Kuka scanned sea ice at every 5 m intervals and sampled 7 measurements. Ka-scat scanned first followed by moving the sled to have Ku scat, followed by Ku scat scan the snow. A metre scale was used to measure the distance from bottom of both antennas to the snow surface. This procedure was followed at all 7 locations. Once KuKa scanning was complete, TLS scanned the KuKa footprint. A spatula was placed 10 cm in front of the front sled rail before TLS scanning. Once TLS scans were complete, we conducted detailed snow pits, ice core samples and dielectric measurements of snow surface/sub-surface by hydraprobe.

On the 15th August we performed a seven-stop transect in North Cove, then digging snow pits at each stop. On the 2nd and 3rd of October we performed similar transects in Hangar Cove. On the 6th of October we sought out a pit at the end of the transect line with significant flooding and scanned that, again digging a detailed pit. Radar power waveforms from each pit can be found in /data/waveforms. The ranges of each data point can be found in /data/.
